# Operating_Platforms 

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
The client was The Gaming Room. The type of software that they wanted me to design was a web-based game application that is based off of their Android game application called, Draw It or Lose It, that functions on various operating platforms. Their software requirements are: the game must use the internet or world wide web and the game must have the ability to function across different platforms and operating systems.     

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 
I evaluated various platforms for their characteristics, advantages and weaknesses for hosting the software application particularly well.   

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 
Working through a design document was helpful when I was developing the code because the design document is a good plan for how to brainstorm an algorithm that fulfills the goal and purpose of the software for the client.  

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
One part of my work on this document that I would pick to revise is the screenshots. I would improve the screenshots within the documents by making the text and details bigger and reducing the amount of white space on the edges of the screenshots to make them look better.  

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
I read and reread what The Gaming Room was requesting and took all of the key points. I also had to think about every possible factor of each user's device that they would use to play the game app. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
My approach was using a software design template to create a software design document. Afterwards, keeping the software design document in mind, I created a flowchart to display each step of the algorithm of the code. After that, I would create a pseudocode version of the flowchart. Next, I would start to write the code based off of the pseudocode. Finally, I would debug the lines of code while I develop the program. I will use all of these steps within my approach to designing software to analyze and design a similar software application in the future.
